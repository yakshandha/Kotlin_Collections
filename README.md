# Kotlin_Collections
A collection usually contains a number of objects of the same type (and its subtypes). Objects in a collection are called elements or items. For example, all the students in a department form a collection that can be used to calculate their average age.

The following are the collection types
- **List** is an ordered collection with access to elements by indices
- **Set** is a collection of Unique Elements
- **Map** is a collection of key-value pairs
